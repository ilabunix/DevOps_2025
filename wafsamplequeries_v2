1️⃣ Check If WebSEAL Requests Are Being Blocked
If WebSEAL uses a specific User-Agent, check if it's getting blocked:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri,
  headers.value AS user_agent
FROM waf_logs 
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(httprequest.headers) AS t(headers)
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND headers.name = 'User-Agent'
AND headers.value LIKE '%WebSEAL%'  -- Adjust based on WebSEAL's User-Agent
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ Find out if WebSEAL requests are being blocked based on User-Agent.

2️⃣ Find Blocked WebSEAL Requests Based on a Specific Header
If WebSEAL adds a custom header (e.g., X-WebSEAL-Auth), filter WAF logs for it.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri,
  headers.name AS header_name,
  headers.value AS header_value
FROM waf_logs 
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(httprequest.headers) AS t(headers)
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND headers.name = 'X-WebSEAL-Auth'  -- Adjust based on WebSEAL's headers
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ Check if WebSEAL requests are being blocked due to missing/invalid headers.

3️⃣ Find Blocked Requests from WebSEAL’s IP Range
If WebSEAL sends requests from a known IP range, check if those IPs are being blocked.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND httprequest.clientip LIKE 'XXX.XXX.XXX.%'  -- Replace with WebSEAL IP range
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ Find if WebSEAL IP addresses are blocked.

4️⃣ Compare WebSEAL Requests (Blocked vs. Allowed)
To check whether WebSEAL requests are being allowed or blocked, remove the action = 'BLOCK' condition.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,  -- Shows BLOCK, ALLOW, COUNT
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri
FROM waf_logs
WHERE httprequest.clientip LIKE 'XXX.XXX.XXX.%'  -- Replace with WebSEAL IP range
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ See how WAF is handling WebSEAL traffic.

5️⃣ Find the Most Blocked IPs
Check which IPs are getting blocked the most.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  httprequest.clientip, 
  COUNT(*) AS block_count
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
GROUP BY httprequest.clientip
ORDER BY block_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
✅ Identify repeated malicious IPs.

6️⃣ Most Frequently Triggered WAF Rules
Find which WAF rules are triggering the most blocks.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  terminatingruleid, 
  COUNT(*) AS block_count
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
GROUP BY terminatingruleid
ORDER BY block_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
✅ Find out which WAF rule is causing most blocks.

7️⃣ Top 10 Blocked URLs (Endpoints)
Check which URLs are being blocked the most.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  httprequest.uri, 
  COUNT(*) AS block_count
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
GROUP BY httprequest.uri
ORDER BY block_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
✅ Find attack hotspots on your application.

8️⃣ Requests Blocked by Rate-Based Rule
If you use rate-based WAF rules, find out if they’re blocking WebSEAL requests.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND terminatingruletype = 'RATE_BASED'
AND year = date_format(current_date, '%Y') 
AND month = date_format(current_date, '%m') 
AND day = date_format(current_date, '%d') 
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ Check if WebSEAL is exceeding WAF rate limits.

9️⃣ Real-Time Query for Last 30 Minutes
To monitor WAF blocked requests from the last 30 minutes, use:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago' AS readable_timestamp,
  action,
  webaclid,
  terminatingruleid,
  httprequest.clientip,
  httprequest.uri
FROM waf_logs
WHERE action = 'BLOCK'
AND from_unixtime(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT)) >= now() - interval '30' minute
ORDER BY readable_timestamp DESC;
✅ Useful for live monitoring of WAF activity.
