CFS 2 Migration Support – CMCv2

As part of the CFS 2 migration efforts, I am providing technical guidance, environment setup, security alignment, and infrastructure monitoring for the CMCv2 application. My contributions include:

1. Environment Setup & Access Management
	•	Reviewing AWS accounts to ensure proper configurations and permissions.
	•	Submitting necessary NIT requests for the creation of Okta groups and custom role assignments.
	•	Assisting with GitLab Group Manager setup by collaborating with CES to ensure proper access control.

2. Security & Secrets Management
	•	Handling certificate management and secrets storage, ensuring compliance with CES security standards.
	•	Providing best practices to maintain consistency across applications and align with CES policies.

3. Infrastructure Support & Issue Resolution
	•	Assisting Application Development Teams (ADTs) with environment troubleshooting, resolving issues encountered during migration.
	•	Bi-weekly Operational Readiness Checklist (ORC) reviews to track migration progress, aligning with PI planning, and ensuring tickets are created for required work.

4. Data Movement & Deployment Support
	•	Worked with AWS Architects to define and implement a data movement solution, deploying the required stack in CFS1 to facilitate migration to CFS2.

5. Monitoring & Observability
	•	Leading efforts to define infrastructure-level alerting requirements.
	•	Developing Grafana dashboards and setting up alerting mechanisms to enhance real-time monitoring and operational visibility.

Through these efforts, I am ensuring a structured, secure, and well-monitored migration of CMCv2 to CFS 2, aligning with organizational security and operational standards.
